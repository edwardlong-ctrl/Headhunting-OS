# Current Engineering Snapshot

This file contains mutable short-term engineering state. Update it after future successful main merges.

## Current Main Baseline

- main HEAD before Task 7C worktree: `8e212fb3c5068ea0117bb26be16e47b49ef037fe`
- latest merged commit before Task 7C: Add client-safe projection read model
- Task 7C worktree validation: 349 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 1 skipped
- merge status: Task 7C pending review/merge; do not self-reference the final commit here

## Completed Major Tasks

- Task 0: Source of Truth ✅
- Task 1: Production Skeleton ✅
- Task 2: Truth Layer Foundation ✅
- Task 3: Truth Layer Persistence & Domain Services ✅
- Task 3F: Roadmap / status / known gaps materialized ✅
- Task 4: WorkflowEvent / Audit Foundation ✅
- Task 5: Governed Intake Minimal Slice ✅
- Task 6: Candidate Canonical Profile minimal slice ✅
- Task 7A: Client-safe projection contract / policy / vocabulary ✅
- Task 7B: Client-safe projection service / read-model boundary ✅
- Task 7C: Re-identification placeholder / Task 7 regression closure ✅
- Task 7: Client-safe Projection & Privacy Boundary ✅ for current backend kernel scope

## Current Truth/Kernel Capabilities

- ClaimLedger append persistence exists.
- ReviewEvent append persistence exists.
- WorkflowEvent append/audit foundation exists.
- CanonicalWriteGate exists and must be used before canonical writes.
- CanonicalWriteService boundary exists.
- CandidateProfile minimal canonical field write exists through the gated transaction path.
- CandidateProfile lineage/stale/conflict metadata persistence exists.
- `ClientSafeCandidateCard` now exists as a backend-only anonymous contract.
- `ClientVisibleCandidateFieldPolicy` now denies forbidden and unknown client-visible candidate fields.
- `RedactionLevel` now defines L0-L4 vocabulary, with L4 separated from anonymous client-safe card exposure.
- `ClientSafeCandidateProjectionService` now projects an internal candidate/profile-like snapshot into `ClientSafeCandidateCard` only.
- The minimal projection boundary validates selected client-visible fields through `ClientVisibleCandidateFieldPolicy`, rejects L4, and blocks exact raw sensitive value carryover into safe output text.
- A deterministic backend-only `ReidentificationRiskAssessmentService` placeholder now records obvious re-identification risk categories and returns allow/generalize/review/block decisions.
- Task 7 regression coverage now proves the client-safe contract, forbidden-field policy, L0-L4 vocabulary, projection/read-model boundary, raw exposure negative cases, and re-identification placeholder.

## Current Known Gaps

- Task 7 is complete only for the current backend kernel scope.
- No real re-identification risk scorer exists beyond the deterministic Task 7C placeholder.
- No API/controller/UI yet.
- No RBAC/ABAC yet.
- No Consent/Disclosure/Unlock implementation yet.
- No real redaction pipeline or automatic text rewriting yet.
- No real AI extraction/model wiring yet.
- No workflow engine or transition legality validation yet.
- No stale detection engine.
- No conflict resolution workflow.
- No full CandidateProfile engine.
- Blocked canonical attempts still have no separate persisted audit ledger.
- recruiting.* source/packet cleanup/deprecation remains deferred.

## Current Leftover Cleanup Note

Task 6F worktree was not deleted because it contains an untracked Vim swap file:

`/Users/edwardlong/.codex/worktrees/fc08/New project/services/core-api/src/test/java/com/recruitingtransactionos/coreapi/candidateprofile/.CandidateProfileContractTest.java.swp`

This worktree has already been merged to main, but cleanup was safely skipped. Do not force-delete it. Close the relevant Vim/editor/session and confirm recovery is unnecessary before deleting the swap file/worktree.

## Next Recommended Task

Task 8A: Identity / RBAC / ABAC kernel foundation

## Future Prompt Strategy

Future Codex prompts should normally include only:

- task name
- current main HEAD
- instruction to read `docs/roadmap/codex-task-operating-rules.md`
- instruction to read `docs/roadmap/current-engineering-snapshot.md`
- local task-relevant files to inspect
- goal
- forbidden scope
- validation commands if not already referenced
- final report requirements if special additions are needed
